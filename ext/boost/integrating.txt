This file describes the integration process for adding new versions of the boost
python integration library to the Vega Strike build system.
Assuming that the version of boost works with Vega Strike, very little
developer time should be required.

1.  Create new directory under ext/boost of $VER, where $Ver has the dot (".") replaced with underscore ("_").
    For example ext/boost/1_72_0

2.  Download the release from here https://www.boost.org/users/download/
    and extract it to the above directory.

3.  Edit engine/CMakeLists.txt (search for Boost_DIR) and adjust the path
    SET(Boost_DIR ../ext/boost/1_72_0)

5.  Test new boost sources.
    a)  remove the build directory
    b)  run sh/vsbuild.sh
